## Architecture Changes

### Before: Flat Structure
```
src/
├── config/
├── telegram/
├── workflow/
├── vision/
├── categorizer/
├── database/
└── utils/
```

**Issues:**
- Prompts embedded in business logic
- No clear feature boundaries
- Difficult to locate code
- Hard to add new features

### After: Feature-Based with Centralized Prompts
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── receipt-processing/
│   │   ├── categorizer/
│   │   ├── vision/
│   │   └── workflow/
│   └── telegram-bot/
├── prompts/
│   ├── receipt/
│   └── shared/
├── core/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── database/
│   └── utils/
└── index.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- Prompts centralized and easy to manage
- Clear feature boundaries
- Easy to locate code
- Simple to add new features

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Centralized Prompt Management 🎯

**Before:**
```typescript
// Embedded in vision-processor.ts
private buildVisionPrompt(): string {
  return `You are an expert...`;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// src/prompts/receipt/extraction.ts
export function buildExtractionPrompt(): string {
  return `You are an expert...`;
}

// Usage in vision-processor.ts
import { buildExtractionPrompt } from '../../../prompts/receipt/extraction';
const prompt = buildExtractionPrompt();
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to find and update prompts
- Non-technical team members can improve prompts
- Version control friendly
- A/B testing possible

### 2. Feature-Based Organization 📦

**Before:**
```
src/vision/
src/categorizer/
src/workflow/
```

**After:**
```
src/features/receipt-processing/
├── vision/
├── categorizer/
└── workflow/
```

**Benefits:**
- Self-contained features
- Clear ownership
- Easy to add new features
- Better code organization

### 3. Modular Workflow 🔄

**Before:**
```typescript
// All nodes in one file (workflow.ts)
export async function receiveImageNode() { }
export async function extractDataNode() { }
export async function categorizeNode() { }
// ... 500+ lines
```

**After:**
```
workflow/
├── nodes/
│   ├── receive-image.ts
│   ├── extract-data.ts
│   ├── categorize.ts
│   ├── request-clarification.ts
│   ├── store-transaction.ts
│   └── send-confirmation.ts
├── graph.ts
└── types.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to test individual nodes
- Better code organization
- Simpler to add new nodes
- Reduced file size

### 4. Core Infrastructure 🏗️

**Before:**
```
src/database/
src/utils/
src/config/
```

**After:**
```
src/core/
├── config/
├── database/
└── utils/
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear shared infrastructure
- Centralized configuration
- Easy to access from features
- Better organization

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Update Imports:**
```typescript
// Before
import { VisionProcessor } from './src/vision/vision-processor';

// After
import { VisionProcessor } from './src/features/receipt-processing/vision';
```

**Use Feature Exports:**
```typescript
// Recommended
import { 
  VisionProcessor, 
  TransactionCategorizer 
} from './src/features/receipt-processing';
```

### For Prompt Engineers

**Prompts are now centralized:**
- Vision extraction: `src/prompts/receipt/extraction.ts`
- Categorization: `src/prompts/receipt/categorization.ts`
- Suggestions: `src/prompts/receipt/suggestion.ts`

**To update a prompt:**
1. Navigate to the prompt file
2. Edit the prompt text
3. Test the changes
4. No code changes needed!
