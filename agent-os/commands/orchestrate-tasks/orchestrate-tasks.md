# Process for Orchestrating a Spec's Implementation

Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with orchestrating implementation of each task group by a dedicated agent using the following MULTI-PHASE process.

Follow each of these phases and their individual workflows IN SEQUENCE:

## Multi-Phase Process

### FIRST: Get tasks.md for this spec

IF you already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder has a `tasks.md` file, then use that and skip to the NEXT phase.

IF you don't already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder doesn't yet have a `tasks.md` THEN output the following request to the user:

```
Please point me to a spec's `tasks.md` that you want to orchestrate implementation for.

If you don't have one yet, then run any of these commands first:
/shape-spec
/write-spec
/create-tasks
```

### NEXT: Create orchestration.yml to serve as a roadmap for orchestration of task groups

In this spec's folder, create this file: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/orchestration.yml`.

Populate this file with with the names of each task group found in this spec's `tasks.md` and use this EXACT structure for the content of `orchestration.yml`:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```


### NEXT: Ask user to assign standards to each task group

Next we must determine which standards should guide the implementation of each task group.  Ask the user to provide this info using the following request to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Please specify the standard(s) that should be used to guide the implementation of each task group:

1. [task-group-name]
2. [task-group-name]
3. [task-group-name]
[repeat for each task-group you've added to orchestration.yml]

For each task group number, you can specify any combination of the following:

"all" to include all of your standards
"global/*" to include all of the files inside of standards/global
"frontend/css.md" to include the css.md standard file
"none" to include no standards for this task group.
```

Using the user's responses, update `orchestration.yml` to specify those standards for each task group.  `orchestration.yml` should end up having AT LEAST the following information added to it:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
    standards:
      - [users' 1st response for this task group]
      - [users' 2nd response for this task group]
      - [users' 3rd response for this task group]
      # Repeat for all standards that the user specified for this task group
  - name: [task-group-name]
    standards:
      - [users' 1st response for this task group]
      - [users' 2nd response for this task group]
      # Repeat for all standards that the user specified for this task group
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

For example, after this step, the `orchestration.yml` file might look like this (exact names will vary):

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: authentication-system
    standards:
      - all
  - name: user-dashboard
    standards:
      - global/*
      - frontend/components.md
      - frontend/css.md
  - name: task-group-with-no-standards
  - name: api-endpoints
    standards:
      - backend/*
      - global/error-handling.md
```

Note: If the `use_claude_code_subagents` flag is enabled, the final `orchestration.yml` would include BOTH `claude_code_subagent` assignments AND `standards` for each task group.


### NEXT: Generate prompts

Now we must generate an ordered series of prompt texts, which will be used to direct the implementation of each task group listed in `orchestration.yml`.

Follow these steps to generate this spec's ordered series of prompts texts, each in its own .md file located in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/implementation/prompts/`.

LOOP through EACH task group in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and for each, use the following workflow to generate a markdown file with prompt text for each task group:

#### Step 1. Create the prompt markdown file

Create the prompt markdown file using this naming convention:
`agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/implementation/prompts/[task-group-number]-[task-group-title].md`.

For example, if the 3rd task group in tasks.md is named "Comment System" then create `3-comment-system.md`.

#### Step 2. Populate the prompt file

Populate the prompt markdown file using the following Prompt file content template.

##### Bracket content replacements

In the content template below, replace "[spec-title]" and "[this-spec]" with the current spec's title, and "[task-group-number]" with the current task group's number.

To replace "[orchestrated-standards]", use the following workflow:

#### Compile Implementation Standards

Use the following logic to compile a list of file references to standards that should guide implementation:

##### Steps to Compile Standards List

1. Find the current task group in `orchestration.yml`
2. Check the list of `standards` specified for this task group in `orchestration.yml`
3. Compile the list of file references to those standards, one file reference per line, using this logic for determining which files to include:
   a. If the value for `standards` is simply `all`, then include every single file, folder, sub-folder and files within sub-folders in your list of files.
   b. If the item under standards ends with "*" then it means that all files within this folder or sub-folder should be included. For example, `frontend/*` means include all files and sub-folders and their files located inside of `agent-os/standards/frontend/`.
   c. If a file ends in `.md` then it means this is one specific file you must include in your list of files. For example `backend/api.md` means you must include the file located at `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`.
   d. De-duplicate files in your list of file references.

##### Output Format

The compiled list of standards should look something like this, where each file reference is on its own line and begins with `@`. The exact list of files will vary:

```
@agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
@agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
@agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/authentication.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/endpoints.md
@agent-os/standards/backend/api/responses.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md
@agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md
```


#### Prompt file content template:

```markdown
We're continuing our implementation of [spec-title] by implementing task group number [task-group-number]:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

[paste entire task group including parent task, all of its' sub-tasks, and sub-bullet points]

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

Also read these further context and reference:
- @agent-os/specs/[this-spec/]/planning/requirements.md
- @agent-os/specs/[this-spec/]/planning/visuals

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md, requirements.md, and visuals (if any)
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **Specific notes provided in requirements.md, spec.md AND/OR tasks.md**
- **Visuals provided (if any)** which would be located in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/visuals/`
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.
  - Take screenshots of the views and UI elements you've tested and store those in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verification/screenshots/`.  Do not store screenshots anywhere else in the codebase other than this location.
  - Analyze the screenshot(s) you've taken to check them against your current requirements.


## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your implementation work is ALIGNED and DOES NOT CONFLICT with the user's preferences and standards as detailed in the following files:

[orchestrated-standards]
```

### Step 3: Output the list of created prompt files

Output to user the following:

```
Ready to begin implementation of [spec-title]!

Use the following list of prompts to direct the implementation of each task group:

[list prompt files in order]

Input those prompts into this chat one-by-one or queue them to run in order.

Progress will be tracked in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`
```
