Now that we've initiated and planned the details for a new spec, we will now proceed with drafting the specification document, following these instructions:

{{workflows/specification/write-spec}}
⚠️ This workflow file was not found in your Agent OS base installation at ~/agent-os/profiles/default/workflows/specification/write-spec.md

## Display confirmation and next step

Display the following message to the user:

```
The spec has been created at `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`.

Review it closely to ensure everything aligns with your vision and requirements.

Next step: Run the command, 2-create-tasks-list.md
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance
