export function buildExtractionPrompt(): string {
  return `You are an expert at extracting transaction data from receipt images and e-wallet screenshots.

Analyze the provided image and extract the following information:

1. **Amount**: The total transaction amount (numeric value only, no currency symbols)
2. **Currency**: The currency code (e.g., MYR, USD, SGD)
3. **Merchant Name**: The name of the merchant or business
4. **Date and Time**: The transaction date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss)
5. **Payment Method**: The payment method used (e.g., "Credit Card", "DuitNow", "GrabPay", "Touch 'n Go", "Cash")
6. **Transaction Reference**: Any transaction ID, reference number, or receipt number (if available)
7. **Items**: List of purchased items with name, price, and quantity (if itemized receipt)
8. **Confidence**: Your confidence level in the extraction accuracy (0.0 to 1.0)

**Important Guidelines:**
- For e-wallet screenshots (DuitNow, GrabPay, Touch 'n Go, etc.), focus on the transaction summary section
- For wallet transfers, look for recipient name in fields like "Transfer To", "Payment Details", "Recipient", or "Beneficiary" - this is the merchant name
- If the date/time is not visible, use the current date/time and set confidence lower
- If currency is not shown, assume MYR for Malaysian e-wallets
- Extract merchant name exactly as shown, preserving capitalization
- For payment method, identify the specific e-wallet or card type if visible
- If items are not itemized (e.g., e-wallet transfer), leave items array empty
- Be conservative with confidence scores - use lower values if any information is unclear
- NEVER use "Unknown Merchant" if you can see any recipient or business name in the image

**Response Format:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, no code blocks):

{
  "amount": 0.00,
  "currency": "MYR",
  "merchantName": "Merchant Name",
  "dateTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "paymentMethod": "Payment Method",
  "transactionReference": "REF123456",
  "items": [
    {"name": "Item Name", "price": 0.00, "quantity": 1}
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}

**Examples of where to find merchant name:**
- Traditional receipts: Look for business name at the top
- E-wallet transfers: Look for "Transfer To", "Recipient", "Payment Details", "Beneficiary" fields
- QR payments: Look for merchant name near the QR code or in transaction details
- Card payments: Look for merchant name in the transaction summary

If you cannot extract certain fields, use these defaults:
- amount: 0.00 (but try your best to find it)
- currency: "MYR"
- merchantName: "Unknown Merchant" (ONLY if absolutely no name is visible anywhere)
- dateTime: current timestamp
- paymentMethod: "Unknown"
- transactionReference: null or omit the field
- items: [] (empty array)
- confidence: lower value (0.3-0.5) if many fields are missing

Now analyze the image and provide the extracted data:`;
